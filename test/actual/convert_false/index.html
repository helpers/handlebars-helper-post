<!-- Nested-included content -->
This content won't be included if the `cwd` is set directly on the
options of the helper, or on the hash options, but not on this instance.
In other words, this particular instance below won't be using the `cwd`
that was set on the other instances.

Thus, if you don't see the content defined by `{{post 'baz.md'}}` below,
then that is what's happening.
